# Software Architecture Portfolio

A compact collection of work that shows how I design and ship pragmatic, enterprise‑ready software. Clear architectures. Maintainable code. Measurable impact.

## Featured project

### [Enterprise YAML‑Based Testing Framework](./enterprise-testing-framework/)
Location: [enterprise-testing-framework/](./enterprise-testing-framework/)

Why it’s useful
- Define tests in YAML (functional + performance)
- Mix HTTP, RPC, MBUS, CMD, and Scripts in one flow
- Extend safely via plugins; no core changes required
- CI‑friendly outputs for gating and reporting

See
- [Project overview](./enterprise-testing-framework/README.md)
- [Examples](./enterprise-testing-framework/examples/)
- [Architecture](./enterprise-testing-framework/docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Tests (curated)](./enterprise-testing-framework/tests/)

## How to browse
- Start with the project README for the quick tour
- Jump into docs for design decisions and extension points
- Open examples to see real cases you can run and adapt

---

## About my approach
- Architectures that are easy to explain and evolve
- Strong defaults; extensibility where it matters
- Honest documentation grounded in what exists today

If this aligns with what you need, the project links above are the best place to dive in.
